# Database Configuration (Placeholder - user asked for no docker for now, but valid config needed for startup if DB exists, else H2 for test?)
# Assuming it will connect to localhost if user runs it locally against a local DB, or we can use H2 for now if no DB is provided.
# Given the user requested "make me one more microservice", I'll stick to MySQL config consistent with others but maybe H2 for standalone ease if they don't have MySQL running? 
# The other services use MySQL in docker. I'll stick to standard MySQL config but maybe using localhost since docker is out.
# Or better, H2 for easy standalone start? User said "complemente the already existing once", which are mysql.
# I'll use placeholders that matched docker-compose but pointing to localhost maybe?
# Let's use H2 for now to ensure it starts up without external dependencies, since Docker is excluded.
